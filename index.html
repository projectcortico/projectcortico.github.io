      <section>
      <p>Minimally invasive procedures and complex biopsies like brain tumour excisions, liver, lung and renal
biopsies and ablations require accurate intra-operative image guidance and visualization to avoid
complications. Surgical navigation systems represent the state-of-art in the current global standard
of care.</p>
<p>
Current solutions have problems that span across product design, inherent limitations of the
technology and complex workflows. The cost of the tracking technology and the economy of scale
that the large companies in the navigation business have to deal with create a high total cost of
ownership for these systems. All these factors have limited the market potential and widespread
adoption of navigation system. In India, the market penetration is very low.
We plan to build an integrated visualization and navigation system which provides:
<ul>
<li>Essential preoperative and intraoperative data access without disrupting surgery workflow</li>
<li>A gesture based natural user interface for ease of registration and visual feedback on its
accuracy</li>
<li>Proprietary technology for head and tool tracking</li>
</ul>
The system has potential to make future minimally invasive surgeries quicker, more reliable and
effective

          </div>
 Nikhil Chandwadkar is a medical systems designer with prior experience in the medical device development lifecycle, regulatory
compliance, intellectual property and sensors and systems. He was previously employed with Philips, where he was responsible for
the research and development of advanced capacitive sensor technology for non-contact collision prevention of robotic Cathlab
C-arms in the OR. He patented and deployed this technology across a global install base of FDA and CE certified products in the market. 
Prior to Philips, he co-developed an automated image analysis system for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal images which is 
currently in clinical use at LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. He has also worked with the University of Twente, Netherlands to 
develop sensor based safety mechanisms for a robotic exoskeleton. Nikhil holds a BTech. and MTech. both from IIT Madras with a 
specialization in Biomedical Design from the department of Engineering Design.

 Hem Rampal has prior experience in sensor fusion algorithms, environment mapping, robotics, image processing and product
development. As part of HASETRI, he has worked on sensor fusion algorithms for capturing drive data characteristics of vehicles and
implementing them for analyzing raw IMU and GPS data captured from an in-house designed sensor data acquisition platform. He
has previously worked on unmanned aerial vehicle localization and mapping in unstructured indoor environments during his
undergraduate studies at IIT Madras, when his team represented India in the International Aerial Robotics Competition 2009. As part
of his Master's thesis, he co-designed a complete software product for automated diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy in fundus
images, which is currently in clinical use at LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. As part of the Medical Device Innovation Lab at 
IIT Madras, he has also designed and developed a low cost syringe pump. Hem holds a BTech. and MTech. both from IIT Madras in Engineering 
Design.

 Bhargava Chintalapati is an embedded systems engineer with an applied mathematics background. He was previously employed
with Qualcomm, working on various projects involving FPGAs pre-silicon , board bring up post-silicon and firmware. Vulcan, a
bare-metal thermal profiling platform conceptualized and developed by him was presented at the Qualcomm Global Thermal Summit
2015, San Diego. While interning at Fairchild Semiconductor his work on an efficient buck converter architecture was published at the
PCIM Europe, 2012. Exposure to working in an environment that is devoid of all the software abstractions is a unique dimension in
the skill set of the current team. Bhargava holds a BTech. and MTech. both from IIT Madras in Electrical Engineering with a
specialization in VLSI.
