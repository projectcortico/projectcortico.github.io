      <section>
      <p>Put Minimally invasive procedures and complex biopsies like brain tumour excisions, liver, lung and renal
biopsies and ablations require accurate intra-operative image guidance and visualization to avoid
complications. Surgical navigation systems represent the state-of-art in the current global standard
of care.</p>
<p>
Current solutions have problems that span across product design, inherent limitations of the
technology and complex workflows. The cost of the tracking technology and the economy of scale
that the large companies in the navigation business have to deal with create a high total cost of
ownership for these systems. All these factors have limited the market potential and widespread
adoption of navigation system. In India, the market penetration is very low.
We plan to build an integrated visualization and navigation system which provides:
<ul>
<li>Essential preoperative and intraoperative data access without disrupting surgery workflow</li>
<li>A gesture based natural user interface for ease of registration and visual feedback on its
accuracy</li>
<li>Proprietary technology for head and tool tracking</li>
The system has potential to make future minimally invasive surgeries quicker, more reliable and
effective
</ul>

Nikhil Chandwadkar is a medical systems designer with prior experience in the medical device development lifecycle, regulatory compliance, intellectual property and sensors and systems. He was previously employed with Philips, where he was responsible for the research and development of advanced capacitive sensor technology for non-contact collision prevention of robotic Cathlab C-arms in the OR. He patented and deployed this technology across a global install base of a CE certified product in the market and another upcoming product variant. Prior to Philips, he co-developed an automated image analysis system for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. He has also worked with the University of Twente, Netherlands to develop sensor based safety mechanisms for a robotic exoskeleton.

            [<a href="docs/ipimu/ipimu.html">Link</a>]</div>
Hem Rampal has prior experience in sensor fusion algorithms, environment mapping, robotics, image processing and product development. As part of HASETRI,  he has worked on sensor fusion algorithms for capturing drive data characteristics of vehicles and implementing them for analyzing raw IMU and GPS data captured from an in-house designed sensor data acquisition platform. He has previously worked on unmanned aerial vehicle localization and mapping in unstructured indoor environments, his team represented India in the International Aerial Robotics Competition 2009. As part of his Masterâ€™s thesis, he co-designed a complete software product for automated diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy in fundus images, he has also designed and developed a low cost syringe pump.

Bhargava Chintalapati is an embedded systems engineer with an applied mathematics background. He was previously employed with Qualcomm, working on various projects involving FPGAs (pre-silicon), board bring up (post-silicon) and firmware. Vulcan, a bare-metal thermal profiling platform conceptualized and developed by him was presented at the Qualcomm Global Thermal Summit 2015, San Diego. While interning at Fairchild Semiconductor his work on an efficient buck convertor architecture was published at the PCIM Europe, 2012. Exposure to working in an environment that is devoid of all the software abstractions is a unique dimension in the skill set of the current team.
